### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am @carbonphyber. I care a lot about facts, statistics, data, rational thinking, and learning.

In my day job, I work in front-end data vizualizations for cybersecurity.

In my personal time, I love learning about everything.

In 2021, I contributed to @OpenElections. I would encourage others to volunteer some of their time to do the same.

Currently looking for projects which can communicate stories about how the United States of America could be improved using visuals, stats, and raw data.
